{"_id":"6cboL9uLZYGBsFv1","name":"1. Concepts","content":"<p>The tribes consist of a variety of strange and quirky individuals. Included here are examples of the sort of</p>\n<p>goblins that might achieve the rank of gang boss. Full characters can be found in the archetypes book.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Barghest Whelp</h2>\n<p>These ferocious shapeshifters can transform between goblin, wolf and hybrid forms at will, diving fearlessly</p>\n<p>into combat and fighting with fang and claw. You are a rising star in the tribe, and have proven your worth in</p>\n<p>battle on many occasions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bugbear Brute</h2>\n<p>Bugbears are the largest and strongest of the goblinoid breeds, and those who join the tribes frequently rise to</p>\n<p>positions of power. You might not always make the best decisions, but very few of your smaller goblin kin</p>\n<p>are brave (or stupid) enough to question the wisdom of your actions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Canitaur Crossbowman</h2>\n<p>Goblins are an extremely prolific race, and prone to unusual mutations. You are a canitaur, a particularly</p>\n<p>rare type of goblin with the lower body of a canine, and you’ve learned to use your mutation to dominate</p>\n<p>the battle field, outmaneuvering your enemies while raining death upon them from a distance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Priestess/Lorekeeper</h2>\n<p>Most of the Redfang tribe prays to the Shadow Queen and the Sleeping God, who slumbers within the Spire</p>\n<p>of Flame. According to prophecy, the Sleeping God shall one day awaken, and rain fiery death down upon</p>\n<p>those who threaten his children. As a devout priestess or lorekeeper, you eagerly await the return of your progenitor.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Psionicist</h2>\n<p>Although the vast majority of goblins have green skin, those with strong psionic gifts often have a distinctive</p>\n<p>blue coloration. Such individuals are both prized and feared by the tribes, and frequently rise to at least the</p>\n<p>rank of gang boss. You always knew you were special, and that your gifts granted you a significant advantage</p>\n<p>over your green-skinned brethren.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Psychonaut</h2>\n<p>Goblins prefer eating meat, such as fish, insects, and sometimes even each other. However their population</p>\n<p>density combined with their deep hatred of vegetables means they need to supplement their diet with other</p>\n<p>nutrients. You grew up on a vast underground fungus farm, and the constant exposure to the spores has left</p>\n<p>a permanent mark upon your psyche.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Pyromancer</h2>\n<p>Elemental magic is fairly common among the tribes, and pyromancy is very popular among the sorcerers</p>\n<p>of the Redfang tribe. You’re always eager to set fire to your enemies, and you take great pleasure in watching</p>\n<p>human settlements burn to the ground.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Scout</h2>\n<p>You grew up in the Great Woods to the south, near the territory of some forest humans. These fearsome foes</p>\n<p>are competent hunters, and unlike town humans, they have excellent night vision. Fortunately you’re a fast</p>\n<p>learner with superb reflexes, and were able to adapt and even thrive in the hostile environment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Thug</h2>\n<p>Some goblinoids undergo a stage of disproportionate growth during their adolescence, leaving them with a</p>\n<p>grossly oversized body part, such as a limb, nose, or even their torso. You had the fortune of undergoing a</p>\n<p>particularly beneficial growth spurt, your right hand and arm swelling to enormous proportions, and this</p>\n<p>“war fist” gives you a significant advantage in combat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin Wolf Rider</h2>\n<p>Although they are very prolific, goblins have a rather high mortality rate, and most of the tribes aggressively</p>\n<p>recruit any smaller groups they encounter. You were once a gang boss for the Wolfboys, a particularly small</p>\n<p>tribe of wolf riders who were ambushed by a posse of Redfang recruiters, and bludgeoned with cudgels until</p>\n<p>they agreed to join the larger tribe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gremlin Saboteur</h2>\n<p>According to ancient legends, gremlins and goblins originated from a distant empire, where the citizens</p>\n<p>were divided by caste; gremlins are descended from the intelligent and powerful overlords, and the goblins</p>\n<p>are descended from the uneducated commoners. Like most gremlins, you’re clever and destructive, with a</p>\n<p>passion for deadly mechanical devices.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Half-Human Berserker</h2>\n<p>Along the borders of the human lands, timid goblins cower in their caves. Bloodthirsty human adventurers</p>\n<p>frequently raid these underground lairs, killing and looting with impunity, and such displays of strength</p>\n<p>and virility will sometimes catch the eye of a young goblin maiden. You are the hideous offspring of such a</p>\n<p>union, and have turned to a life of excessive savagery in an attempt to prove your worth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Hobgoblin Marauder</h2>\n<p>Larger and tougher than regular goblins, hobgoblins revel in the thrill of battle, and often travel the human</p>\n<p>lands in small warbands. Occasionally they even work for humans as mercenaries, but more often they take</p>\n<p>to banditry. Attaining the rank of gang boss was as easy as taking candy from a child, and now you have</p>\n<p>an unlimited supply of goblin cannon fodder.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>River Goblin</h2>\n<p>Born in the rapidly flowing waters of the Northern River, you proved your ambition and ferocity at an</p>\n<p>early age by devouring your littermates. As you grew into adulthood you continued to eliminate your rivals,</p>\n<p>for only the strong deserve to survive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Troblin Rat Handler</h2>\n<p>Your incredible regenerative abilities lend credence to the rumors of troll blood running through your veins,</p>\n<p>and you feel at home in the swamps, preferring the company of giant rats over that of your own kin.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4bfin5xnqaf"}}}

When multiple bands merge together they form a “tribe,” with the strongest</p>\n<p>of the family heads declaring themselves chieftain, and the others forming the council of elders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over time the chieftain and elders may be replaced, but this occurs through challenges rather than lineage.</p>\n<p>Technically any member of the tribe can challenge for rank, but open duels are heavily stacked against those</p>\n<p>of lower social status, therefore it’s far more common (and even expected) for goblins to rise in rank through</p>\n<p>trickery and deception; the tribes far prefer cunning leaders over honorable ones.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although goblins are very prolific, they also have a high mortality rate. Therefore most tribes are eager to</p>\n<p>recruit and absorb any smaller groups they encounter, including minor tribes and independent goblin bands</p>\n<p>as well as the occasional gremlin, hobgoblin, bugbear, and even half-human.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All goblins are usually treated with an equal amount of sneering disrespect by their leaders, regardless of</p>\n<p>their breed and gender, with the exception of half- humans – who are only half goblin, after all, and can</p>\n<p>therefore be only half trusted. Some half-humans even attempt to live among human society, only to discover</p>\n<p>that the humans don’t trust them either.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Population Count</h2>\n<p>Around 100,000 goblins belong to the six major tribes, although there are many more independent bands and</p>\n<p>smaller tribes. No one really knows exactly how many goblins there are, as most of them lay low and prefer</p>\n<p>to avoid confrontations whenever possible, but rough estimates place the total goblin population at anything</p>\n<p>between 250,000 and 500,000 individuals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The other four goblinoid breeds are invariably far less common. There are an estimated 10,000 bugbears,</p>\n<p>most of whom either live alone, or in small packs with their kin. Gremlins are rarer still, numbering only a</p>\n<p>few thousand, with most of them living among the goblin tribes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hobgoblins are more numerous, but they are still relatively uncommon, with an estimated population of</p>\n<p>around 25,000 individuals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, there are currently fewer than a hundred half-humans living among the tribes, with perhaps the</p>\n<p>same number again believed to be living among the town humans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Tribal Rank</h2>\n<p>Approximately a quarter of the goblins in each tribe belong to a gang, and these gangs undertake a variety</p>\n<p>of duties, ranging from scouting to hard labor. A gang typically consists of 5-6 members and is led by a boss,</p>\n<p>who earned their rank by demonstrating a blend of deadly skill, raw ambition, and utter ruthlessness.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a chieftain or an elder will assign several different gangs to a particular job, in which case a “big</p>\n<p>boss” might be ordered to lead the crew, receiving all the credit if the mission succeeds, and all of the blame</p>\n<p>if it fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Above the big boss comes the overseer, who leads a posse of perhaps 100-200 goblins, and is expected to</p>\n<p>act on their own initiative. Overseers are often given long-term missions, such as guarding a border, raiding</p>\n<p>a certain area, or recruiting new goblins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next up are the honchos, each of whom lead a troop of around 600-1200 goblins, depending on the size of</p>\n<p>the tribe. Each honcho is responsible for an area of the tribal territory, and they report directly to the chief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally there are the elders, who primarily serve as advisers to the chief. Each elder is expected to have an</p>\n<p>area of specialty, such as arcane knowledge, military expertise or priestly status, and this will traditionally</p>\n<p>determine what role they serve. However in practice, most elders are just as ruthless and ambitious as any</p>\n<p>other goblin, and frequently pursue their own private goals and agendas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"Art/Misc/MajorTribesPlate.jpg\" width=\"373\" height=\"79\" /></p>\n<p>Many noteworthy tribes have come and gone over the years, like the ill-fated Dogboys, and the aptly-named</p>\n<p>Cliffjumpers, but there are currently six major tribes dominating the goblin lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Redfang</h2>\n<p>The Plot Point Campaign in Saga of the Goblin Horde follows the trials and tribulations of the Redfang tribe,</p>\n<p>with the pint-sized antiheroes gradually uncovering the secrets of the other tribes as the story progresses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the size of each tribe fluctuates from day to day, Redfang is always the biggest, with upward of</p>\n<p>25,000 members at any one time. Their size is at least partially due to their equal opportunity recruitment</p>\n<p>policy; they will recruit anyone, regardless of breed, gender, competence, or actual willingness to join the</p>\n<p>tribe. Failing to outrun a cudgel blow to the back of the head is considered acceptance of their offer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bonedigger</h2>\n<p>At around 6,000 members, this is the smallest of the six major tribes. However it is led by a cadre of vicious</p>\n<p>little necromancers, who pad out their goblin ranks with animated corpses. These tireless undead fodder</p>\n<p>allow the tribe to punch well above its weight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Icerunner</h2>\n<p>This tribe first appeared only a few years ago, heading down from the peaks of the Longtooth Mountains to</p>\n<p>claim its place among the major tribes. Many of the tribe members sport a rather frosty appearance, which</p>\n<p>is assumed to be a recent mutation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Longknife</h2>\n<p>Particularly sneaky even by goblin standards, most of the Longknife tribe populate a vast network of caves</p>\n<p>under Westside Plateau. These goblins are particularly well known for their dirty tricks, favoring ambushes</p>\n<p>and assassinations over direct confrontation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Nightsworn</h2>\n<p>The leaders of this tribe are devout worshipers of the Shadow Queen, and Nightsworn goblins can often be</p>\n<p>encountered on pilgrimages, walking from their home in Darkmire Swamp to the Dome of Shadows, at the</p>\n<p>north-west end of the Obsidian Valley.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Stonefist</h2>\n<p>Despite their proximity to the Icerunner goblins, there is practically no interaction between the two tribes,</p>\n<p>because the Icerunners live up on the mountains while the Stonefist tribe makes its homes in the extensive</p>\n<p>cavern networks running through the mountains.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Treebiter</h2>\n<p>Once the seventh major tribe, the Treebiters claimed a small area of territory to the south of the Redfang</p>\n<p>tribe, on the edge of the Great Forest. The Treebiter tribe was destroyed several months ago by the forest</p>\n<p>humans, wiped out in the first blow of the war.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5d6ol5f2t8t"}}}
{"_id":"HfMkaWsC4ua45YnJ","name":"Factions At War","content":"<p>For time immemorial, goblins have been mercilessly hunted down and killed by the so-called “civilized”</p>\n<p>humans, slaughtered in droves for the entertainment of bloodthirsty adventurers.

Until recently they’ve only had to contend with beastfolk and ogrekin, but</p>\n<p>now the tribes are facing a far bigger threat: humans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although there are also countless smaller tribes and independent bands, most of the territory is claimed by</p>\n<p>the six biggest tribes: Redfang, Icerunner, Nightsworn, Bonedigger, Longknife, and Stonefist.</p>\n<p>Individuals from other goblinoid breeds can also be found among the tribes, but they are much rarer than</p>\n<p>the common goblins.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Art/Misc/GoblinsIntroduction.jpg\" width=\"373\" height=\"270\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Humans</h2>\n<p>Although they can vary significantly in height, most humans are roughly as tall as a hobgoblin, but any</p>\n<p>resemblance to that fearsome goblinoid breed ends there. Human heads are hilariously tiny in proportion</p>\n<p>to the rest of their bodies, with small beady eyes and squashed features crowded onto their shrunken faces.</p>\n<p>Their jaws are delicate and narrow, while their teeth are blunt and flat like those of a plant-eater. Human</p>\n<p>skin tones range from pale pink to dark brown, without even a hint of the lustrous green hues found</p>\n<p>among the tribes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite their much-vaunted claims of civility and honor, humans are an extremely vicious race, possibly</p>\n<p>as a side-effect of having such small heads. While the tribes sometimes fight each other over territory or to</p>\n<p>establish dominance, human warbands exterminate entire goblin dens simply for the fun of it. They call</p>\n<p>this activity “adventuring,” and view it as the height of entertainment, showing not even a shred of remorse</p>\n<p>for the piles of hacked-up corpses they leave behind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of the four different human breeds, town humans are probably the most dangerous, mainly due to their</p>\n<p>highly expansionist nature, and they can be found in large numbers on the eastern side of Hightree Ridge.</p>\n<p>The forest and mountain humans are very dangerous individually, but rarely leave their territories in the</p>\n<p>Great Forest and Longtooth Mountains respectively. Hill humans are physically the smallest and weakest of</p>\n<p>the four human breeds, and also the most delicious, but unfortunately they prefer to settle in hilly areas far</p>\n<p>away from the goblin lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Adventuring parties are often made up of a mixture of different human breeds, united by their sociopathic</p>\n<p>urges, but other than that the various breeds usually avoid each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Art/Misc/HumansIntroduction.jpg\" width=\"406\" height=\"326\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beastfolk</h2>\n<p>While the encroaching humans are certainly the latest and greatest threat to the tribes, they are not the only</p>\n<p>danger faced by the goblin horde. Nomadic bands of feral beastfolk wander the land, looting and pillaging</p>\n<p>wherever they please, and the bestial savages have no respect for tribal territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are many different breeds of beastfolk, some more common than others, but they all share a similar</p>\n<p>appearance – humanoid bodies with the features and mannerisms of an animal. The truth of their origin has</p>\n<p>long been lost to the annals of time, but their violent nature suggests that they were originally bred for war.</p>\n<p>Although some beastfolk are loners, most of them prefer to band together with others of the same breed.</p>\n<p>While these bands tend to be much smaller than the goblin tribes, a stampeding herd of minotaurs is still a</p>\n<p>terrifying sight to behold, and a sneaky pack of ratling cutthroats can prove a deadly threat when they catch</p>\n<p>their foes by surprise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most common of the beastfolk are the ratlings, most of whom live in underground nests deep below</p>\n<p>Northside Plateau and the Longtooth Mountains. The catfolk and minotaurs are somewhat rarer, although</p>\n<p>marauding herds of minotaurs are sometimes found wandering the plains, as are the occasional pride of</p>\n<p>catfolk. The frogfolk and porcupine people are rarer still, living in small forest communities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Other beastfolk have also been sighted on occasion. Pods of orcafolk can sometimes be seen swimming in</p>\n<p>the Endless Ocean, although they usually try to avoid the sea goblins. Former members of the Treebiter</p>\n<p>tribe also speak of a beastfolk king, who apparently lives deep in the Great Forest, where he rules over all</p>\n<p>manner of exotic breeds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Art/Misc/BeastfolkIntroduction.jpg\" width=\"393\" height=\"347\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Ogrekin</h2>\n<p>The ogrekin are the last of the major factions, and are divided into two breeds, ogres and orcs. Orcs organize</p>\n<p>themselves by clan, and live in small villages along the northern coast, while the ogres form extended family</p>\n<p>groups reminiscent of goblin bands, and prefer living deep within their mountain caves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both breeds of ogrekin have green skin and brutish features, and many of them sport tusks. Orcs tend to</p>\n<p>be slightly bigger than hobgoblins, usually around six and a half feet tall, while ogres stand at least a full head</p>\n<p>taller than even the towering bugbears, and frequently reach heights of over ten feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the ogrekin generally maintain a neutral stance toward the goblin tribes, territorial conflicts do</p>\n<p>still occur from time to time. Fortunately the orcs are primarily a seafaring race, and show very little interest</p>\n<p>in expanding their territory within the goblin lands, while the ogres usually seem content to live in their</p>\n<p>caves along the edge of the goblin territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ogrekin have a rather unique status as the only creatures the sea goblins will allow to travel through</p>\n<p>their territory unmolested. The reason for this special arrangement is unknown, but it has allowed the orcs</p>\n<p>to spread out across the Endless Ocean to other lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most ogres seem to show little interest in sea travel, but orc captains will usually recruit a handful of their</p>\n<p>larger kin as extra muscle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"Art/Misc/ogrekinIntroduction.jpg\" width=\"389\" height=\"459\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Other Threats</h2>\n<p>In addition to the four major factions, there are also some other creatures worth mentioning.</p>\n<p>First and foremost are the dark slimes, gelatinous blobs that absorb and digest organic matter, although</p>\n<p>they are strict carnivores and appear unable to absorb plants. Dark slimes are often found in Blacktear Lake,</p>\n<p>but will sometimes ooze onto land in search of prey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rather mysteriously, these voracious predators almost always ignore goblinoids and ogrekin.</p>\n<p>However in very rare cases a dark slime has been known to absorb a goblinoid, and when this happens</p>\n<p>they undergo a metamorphosis, transforming into a flesh wraith. This new form is still amorphous, but has</p>\n<p>a flesh-like texture, and it sprouts numerous eyes and fang-lined mouths. Flesh wraiths are very aggressive,</p>\n<p>and will actively hunt and devour any source of meat they can find, including goblinoids. If left to feed, flesh</p>\n<p>wraiths eventually undergo a second metamorphosis, turning into a troll – a near-unstoppable juggernaut of</p>\n<p>unbridled fury.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Trolls are fortunately very rare, as they’re extremely difficult to kill. Most of them live within Darkmire</p>\n<p>Swamp, although that could just be because they followed Darkmire Rapids out of Blacktear Lake.</p>\n<p>Trolls, like dark slimes and flesh wraiths, try to avoid salt water when possible, although it doesn’t appear to</p>\n<p>harm them directly. However this does at least keep them out of the ocean.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yet the Endless Ocean is no safe haven. The waters teem with sea goblins, aggressive brutes who attack</p>\n<p>almost anyone entering their territory. These aquatic savages serve as a natural barrier against attempts by</p>\n<p>the humans to enter the goblin lands by boat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, there are numerous animal predators that hunt the forests, and are hunted in turn by the tribes,</p>\n<p>who prize them for their pelts, teeth, claws, and meat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"Art/Misc/MonstersIntroduction.jpg\" width=\"421\" height=\"330\" /></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5d6ol5f2t8t"}}}

The Voice of the Gods, that sibilant whisper which speaks directly to the minds of the clergy, acts as intermediary for the divine couple. Worshipers of the Beast of the Lake are far more prevalent among the ranks of the river goblins, while many of the bugbears seek guidance and wisdom from animal spirits in the same way as the beastfolk. Goblins who originate from other tribes often bring their faith and beliefs with them, although expressing such beliefs openly may lead to scorn and ridicule.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Shadow Queen</h2>\n<p>The ancient legends describe how the Shadow Queen gave life to the goblins, carrying her children safely in her belly until she reached the promised lands before giving birth. The first generation of goblins were very powerful sorcerers, as well as the architects behind the Spire of Flame and the Dome of Shadows. Many of their living metal artifacts still exist today.</p>\n<p>• Aspect: Shadows, fertility, domination.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Sleeping God</h2>\n<p>Consort of the Shadow Queen, and sire of the goblin race, the Sleeping God slumbers eternally in the apex of the Spire of Flame.

Some among the tribe believe this Snow Oracle abandoned them, others that she freed them to seek out their own fate, or even that she is testing their faith. But whatever the truth, priests of the Snow Oracle possess no magical abilities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Animal Spirits</h2>\n<p>Many bugbears draw their power from animal spirits, much like the beastfolk. However these shamans have Arcane Background (Magic) rather than (Miracles).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Obsidian Heir</h2>\n<p>The firstborn of the Shadow Queen was a warrior and sorcerer without peer, and he led the earliest goblin settlers against the indigenous humans. Although he fell in the final battle, his spirit lives on, and shall one day be reborn to lead the goblins once again. Worshiped almost exclusively by members of the Stonefist tribe, even those who leave the tribe rarely abandon the teachings of the Obsidian Heir.</p>\n<p>• Aspect: Earth, strength, secrets.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beast of the Lake</h2>\n<p>Deep below the surface of Blacktear Lake, a towering goblin-like figure stands guard, a great barbed spear raised in one hand. Some river goblins believe this is the slumbering avatar of their progenitor, others that it is merely a blessed statue of their god, but almost all of them worship the ancient figure, and pray to it for guidance in battle.

They are</p>\n<p>usually seven to eight feet tall, and are covered with a thick coat of</p>\n<p>shaggy fur. Exceptionally cruel and vicious even by goblin standards, the</p>\n<p>bugbears are greatly feared by the human scourge.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Strong: </strong>Bugbears are usually extremely strong. They start with</p>\n<p>a d6 in Strength instead of a d4, and can increase their Strength to d12+2 with normal advances. Their</p>\n<p>great prowess increases their carrying capacity by 1½ times (round up), or double</p>\n<p>if they also have the Brawny Edge.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Towering: </strong>Most bugbears are well over seven feet tall, increasing their Size (and</p>\n<p>therefore their Toughness) by +1. However their sheer size makes it difficult for them to</p>\n<p>use gang members as cover; when using the Meat Shield setting rule, bugbears still suffer</p>\n<p>half damage from the attack (round down), and they don’t receive any protection at all</p>\n<p>against area-effect attacks.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Goblinoid: </strong>Bugbears begin with a free d6 in Stealth, their Darkvision lets them</p>\n<p>ignore all penalties from darkness with a range of 12\", and they also suffer a –4</p>\n<p>penalty to Charisma when dealing with humans.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Vicious: </strong>Bugbears take considerable pleasure in hunting, torturing, murdering and</p>\n<p>devouring their victims, particularly humans, and often collect trophies from those they</p>\n<p>kill, such as ears, fingers, hands, or sometimes even entire heads. Humans seem to view this</p>\n<p>behavior as a personal affront, and perceive the bugbears as a more serious threat than the</p>\n<p>other goblinoid breeds. Whenever the Game Master rolls the dice to determine at random</p>\n<p>who a particular human enemy decides to attack, the human is twice as likely to target</p>\n<p>the bugbear than they are another goblinoid character.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Goblin</h2>\n<p>By far the most common goblinoid breed, goblins are usually between three and four feet tall, with green</p>\n<p>skin, yellow eyes, and bulbous heads.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Agile: </strong>Goblins are quick and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Goblinoid: </strong>Goblins get a free d6 in Stealth, their Darkvision allows them to ignore all penalties from</p>\n<p>darkness with range of 12\", and they suffer a –4 penalty to Charisma when dealing with humans.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Survivor: </strong>Goblins tend to be natural survivors. They begin with a free d6 in Survival.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Diminutive: </strong>Goblins stand three to four feet tall, giving them a Size of –1 and reducing their Toughness</p>\n<p>by 1. They cannot increase their Strength above d8, and cannot take the Small Hindrance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Gremlin</h2>\n<p>While they may resemble goblins physically, gremlins tend to be more intelligent and destructive, and most</p>\n<p>of them have a passion for mechanical devices.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Brainy: </strong>Gremlins are clever and cunning. They start with a d6 in Smarts instead of a d4.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Goblinoid: </strong>Gremlins get a free d6 in Stealth, their Darkvision allows them to ignore all penalties from</p>\n<p>darkness with range of 12\", and they suffer a –4 penalty to Charisma when dealing with humans.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Savvy: </strong>Gremlins have a natural affinity for devices and begin with a free d6 in Repair.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Diminutive: </strong>Gremlins stand three to four feet tall, giving them a Size of –1 and reducing their Toughness</p>\n<p>by 1. They cannot increase their Strength above d8, and cannot take the Small Hindrance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Half-Human</h2>\n<p>The revolting offspring of a human and goblin, these unfortunate outcasts are accepted by neither race.</p>\n<p>Feared by humans and mocked by goblins, they strive long and hard to find their place in the world.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Versatile: </strong>Half-humans are highly versatile due to their human heritage. They begin with one free non-</p>\n<p>Legendary Edge of their choice, although they must still meet all of its requirements other than rank.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Resolute: </strong>Half-humans start with a d6 in Spirit instead of a d4, as only those of particularly strong</p>\n<p>will are able to survive in a goblin tribe.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Outsider: </strong>Half-humans are looked down on and distrusted by both humans and goblins, suffering –2</p>\n<p>Charisma when dealing with either race.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Unpopular: </strong>Half-humans are considered soft and ugly by the tribes, who treat them like second-class</p>\n<p>citizens. Half-human bosses don’t gain any additional gang members from their rank.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Hobgoblin</h2>\n<p>Standing at around five to six feet tall, hobgoblins are far bigger and tougher than regular goblins, and tend</p>\n<p>to be extremely aggressive and warlike.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Tough: </strong>Hobgoblins are tough and resilient. They start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Goblinoid: </strong>Hobgoblins gain a free d6 in Stealth, their Darkvision allows them to ignore penalties from</p>\n<p>darkness with range of 12\", and they suffer a –4 penalty to Charisma when dealing with humans.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Militant: </strong>Hobgoblins are very aggressive and love battle. They may ignore the rank requirement of one</p>\n<p>Combat Edge if they buy it during character creation.</p>\n<p>• <strong>Proud: </strong>Hobgoblins are proud creatures, and suffer a –2 penalty to resist Taunt.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4bfin5xnqaf"}}}

{"_id":"cCcH67hFNbj5Grql","name":"Specific Rules","content":"<h2>Like A Boss</h2>\n<p>The players start the campaign as goblin bosses, each leading their own gang of pint-sized cutthroats. Each boss has a number of gang members equal to half their Spirit die, plus one per rank (except for half-humans, who don’t add their rank). These gang members aren’t particularly loyal, but will usually do what they’re told, and can be controlled by the player during combat. Outside of combat, the gang members just tag along, and are generally treated as an extension of their boss.</p>\n<p>They don’t usually make their own rolls; for trait rolls like Stealth or Notice, assume they succeed when their boss succeeds, and fail if their boss fails. Even during Chases, gang members don’t usually make their own attacks, instead they just run alongside their boss and provide cover (and comic relief).</p>\n<p>The players and Game Master can roleplay the gang members and describe their antics, but the little guys should mostly be kept in the background.</p>\n<p>Lost gang members are generally replaced between adventures, although players may also recruit during a game, at the Game Master’s discretion.</p>\n<p>If a boss is killed, the player can turn one of their remaining gang members into a Wild Card, and take control of the rest of the gang. After the session, the player should create a new character as normal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Meat Shield</h2>\n<p>Goblinoids are extremely vicious and utterly ruthless, and possess absolutely no compunctions about using their own kin as living shields, or even shoving each other into the way of incoming attacks.</p>\n<p>Once per round, any character who suffers one or more wounds from a single attack may spend a Benny to redirect all the damage to an adjacent allied goblin Extra of their choice, even if the unfortunate fellow belongs to another gang.</p>\n<p>Damage from sources other than attacks may also be redirected, at the Game Master’s discretion.</p>\n<p>Against area-effect attacks that also target the meat shield, the character may spend a Benny to halve the damage (round down). This doesn’t add any additional damage to the meat shield, but it does prevent them from evading the attack.</p>\n<p>Due to their size, bugbears cannot redirect damage from area-effect attacks, and they suffer half damage from other attacks (round down for the bugbear; the meat shield still takes the full damage)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Might Makes Right</h2>\n<p>Goblins don’t use cash, they just barter for what they want, or simply take it if they’re strong enough. Each player character starts with a number of knick-knacks equal to half their <strong>Strength</strong> plus two. If the character has @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Intimidation] or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Taunt], they receive an additional number of knick-knacks equal to half the skill die (if they have both skills, just use the highest).</p>\n<p>Knick-knacks represent anything that might catch a goblin’s eye, such as a wooden peg-leg, a purse of gold coins, an embroidered hat, or a polished skull; goblins don’t assign the same value to things as humans. If the player doesn’t wish to track individual knick-knacks, they can simply write down how many they have.</p>\n<p>Knick-knacks can be traded or bartered, and at the Game Master’s discretion may be sacrificed for a one\u0002off +2 bonus to a <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong>Trick</strong> or </span><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Test of Will</span></strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> (see </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">), or a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion] roll. Only one knick-knack can be used for each such roll, the decision must be made before the player rolls, and they should also be able to plausibly incorporate the knick-knack into the narrative for the action. The character automatically loses their knick\u0002knack after using it, either discarding it with the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Trick</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> or</span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Test of Will</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">, or giving it away as a </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">bribe</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Travel</h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Foot Travel</strong></h3>\n<p>Most goblinoids can travel 3 hexes per day, while canitaurs and wolf riders can travel 4 hexes. Movement speed is halved if walking through swamps or hiking over mountains. This assumes the boss spends about a third of each day traveling, a third sleeping, and a third sat around the campfire, bragging about their achievements.</p>\n<p>If the goblins are willing to sacrifice some of their sleeping time, they can push themselves to travel an extra hex each day, but every time they use this option they must make a Vigor roll (make a roll for the boss, and a Group Roll for their gang). Failure results in a level of <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">, and it requires a full day of rest to recover the Fatigue level.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Swimming </strong></h3>\n<p>Amphiblins have the option of swimming along rivers, across Blacktear Lake and through Darkmire Swamp: they can swim a number of hexes per day equal to half their @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Athletics]{Swimming} skill.</p>\n<p>When swimming along a river, they travel an extra hex each day when swimming with the current (i.e., toward the ocean), and 1 fewer hex when swimming against the current (i.e., away from the ocean).</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Rafting </strong></h3>\n<p>Characters can also construct rafts to travel by water. Building a raft requires a successful @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Repair] or @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Survival] roll, and counts as 2 hexes of movement, reduced to 1 hex on a raise; this represents the time and effort that goes into assembling the raft. There is assumed to be enough space on the raft for one boss and their gang.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of rafting is that the boss can put her feet up and relax, while her gang take turns at the oars, rowing around the clock. This allows the raft to travel 6 hexes per day upstream, 12 hexes per day downstream, and 9 hexes per day over Blacktear Lake or through Darkmire Swamp.</p>\n<p>Goblins who are reckless enough to attempt rafting on the ocean can move 6 hexes per day, however they must draw an action card for each hex they travel; on Clubs, a group of sea goblins have spotted the raft, and move in to attack. This usually involves them tearing the raft apart, and then eating the crew</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Simple Encumberence</h2>\n<p>Saga of the Goblin Horde uses a simple encumbrance system, defining Load Limit in terms of “major items” rather than pounds. A major item typically weighs 3-7 pounds, and characters can carry a number of major items equal to their Strength without penalty, or their Strength times 1½ if they have the Brawny Edge.</p>\n<p>Particularly heavy objects count as multiple major items. Lighter objects are called “minor items,” and are not tracked individually, although the Game Master may decide to group several together as one major item.</p>\n<p>Knick-knacks are usually ignored for the purposes of encumbrance, although the Game Master can make exceptions if they wish. However a knick-knack that weighs as much as one or more major items should be very valuable, and could perhaps be sacrificed for a +4 bonus to a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Test]{Trick}, <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Persuasion] or </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Streetwise] roll.</span></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.r5RFXLqX3lRSH8aQ"},"cf":{"id":"temp_l8l4ar65ytm"}}}

{"_id":"o4UAPfYHXZvj3RXt","name":"0. Making Characters","content":"<h2>Step 1: Concept</h2>\n<p>The first and most important step is to visualize your character concept. You don’t need to finalize anything</p>\n<p>at this stage, but you should have at least a rough idea of the type of character you’d like to play, whether it’s</p>\n<p>a towering bugbear brute, a sneaky goblin assassin, an insane gremlin artificer, or whatever else your twisted</p>\n<p>imagination can come up with! Take a look over the concepts in the next section for inspiration, but think</p>\n<p>big; goblin gang bosses are a cut above the average.</p>\n<p>The concept can be refined and polished as you go</p>\n<p>through the character creation process, but the initial seed should be planted before writing anything down.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 2: Race</h2>\n<p>There are five different races available to the players in Saga of the Goblin Horde: Bugbear, goblin, gremlin,</p>\n<p>half-human and hobgoblin. Each of these races has its own advantages and disadvantages, described later in</p>\n<p>this chapter, and you should read over each of them carefully before deciding which of the races best fits</p>\n<p>your character concept.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 3: Hindrances</h2>\n<p>You may select one Major Hindrance and two Minor Hindrances, representing flaws and disabilities central</p>\n<p>to your character concept. Although they are optional, it is strongly recommend that you take your full quota.</p>\n<p>A Major Hindrance is worth 2 bonus points, while the Minor Hindrances are worth 1 bonus point each,</p>\n<p>for a total of 4 points. These points can be spent later to buy Edges, and to raise attributes and skills.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 4: Edges</h2>\n<p>Edges represent the special gifts and abilities that help a goblin boss stand out from the rest of his gang.</p>\n<p>You don’t start with any free Edges (unless you’re a half-human, in which case you begin with one), but</p>\n<p>you can buy Edges for 2 bonus points each.</p>\n<p>Try to choose one or two Edges that are important to your character concept, and make a note of their</p>\n<p>attribute and skill requirements, so that you know which traits you need to raise in the next step.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 5: Traits</h2>\n<p>Your character begins with d6 in one attribute, as determined by race, and d4 in the others. You then</p>\n<p>have 5 points to divide among your attributes, each point increasing an attribute by +1 die step. If you’ve</p>\n<p>chosen any Edges with attribute requirements, raise those attributes first, with any remaining points being</p>\n<p>distributed as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Most of the races begin with a free d6 in one or more skills, but you also have 15 skill points to assign.</p>\n<p>It costs 1 point to take a new skill at d4, or to raise a skill below its linked attribute by +1 die step, and 2</p>\n<p>points to raise a skill above its linked attribute by +1 die step. If you have selected any Edges with skill</p>\n<p>requirements, those skills should be raised first, with any remaining points being distributed as you see fit.</p>\n<p>Any bonus points left over from Hindrances should be used now. You can raise attributes at the cost of 2</p>\n<p>bonus points per +1 die step, or raise skills as if each bonus point were actually a skill point.</p>\n<p>Traits cannot be raised higher than d12, unless an Edge or racial ability explicitly allows it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Skills</strong></h3>\n<p>Saga of the Goblin Horde uses most Savage Worlds Adventurers edition skills. When it comes to Boating, Driving and Piloting; whenever one of these skills would normally be used, roll Agility instead. Should your homebrew call for electronics, roll Smarts instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Languages</strong></h3>\n<p>Languages are handled as Knowledge focuses; see the Knowledge (Language) Table in Savage Worlds for the proficiency levels. Ogrekin and beastfolk converse in the same language as goblinoids, albeit with their own dialects, and even town humans speak a variant of the same tongue. However the forest, mountain and hill humans each speak their own languages.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 6: Equipment</h2>\n<p>Calculate your starting knick-knacks (see the Might Makes Right setting rule), and select your starting gear</p>\n<p>from the Equipment Table.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 7: Derived Stats</h2>\n<p>Calculate your Charisma, Pace, Parry and Toughness, as described in Savage Worlds. Don’t forget to apply</p>\n<p>any modifiers from weapons, shields and armor. Foundry will do much of the legwork here, but it is always good to double check!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Step 8: Final Touches</h2>\n<p>Add the finishing touches to your character concept, which you should have been polishing and refining</p>\n<p>throughout the earlier steps, adding any background information that hasn’t yet been finalized.</p>\n<p>You must also name your character. Goblins of rank (such as bosses) have descriptive compound surnames,</p>\n<p>usually including a body part, such as “Longnose” or “Earslicer” (see the Goblin Surname Table on page 24).</p>\n<p>These aren’t family names, but are instead symbols of prestige among the tribes, awarded by the chief or an</p>\n<p>elder in recognition of the character’s status.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4bfin5xnqaf"}}}

Until recently they’ve only had to contend with beastfolk and ogrekin, but</p>\n<p>now the tribes are facing a far bigger threat: humans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although there are also countless smaller tribes and independent bands, most of the territory is claimed by</p>\n<p>the six biggest tribes: Redfang, Icerunner, Nightsworn, Bonedigger, Longknife, and Stonefist.</p>\n<p>Individuals from other goblinoid breeds can also be found among the tribes, but they are much rarer than</p>\n<p>the common goblins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Humans</h2>\n<p>Although they can vary significantly in height, most humans are roughly as tall as a hobgoblin, but any</p>\n<p>resemblance to that fearsome goblinoid breed ends there. Human heads are hilariously tiny in proportion</p>\n<p>to the rest of their bodies, with small beady eyes and squashed features crowded onto their shrunken faces.</p>\n<p>Their jaws are delicate and narrow, while their teeth are blunt and flat like those of a plant-eater. Human</p>\n<p>skin tones range from pale pink to dark brown, without even a hint of the lustrous green hues found</p>\n<p>among the tribes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Despite their much-vaunted claims of civility and honor, humans are an extremely vicious race, possibly</p>\n<p>as a side-effect of having such small heads. While the tribes sometimes fight each other over territory or to</p>\n<p>establish dominance, human warbands exterminate entire goblin dens simply for the fun of it. They call</p>\n<p>this activity “adventuring,” and view it as the height of entertainment, showing not even a shred of remorse</p>\n<p>for the piles of hacked-up corpses they leave behind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of the four different human breeds, town humans are probably the most dangerous, mainly due to their</p>\n<p>highly expansionist nature, and they can be found in large numbers on the eastern side of Hightree Ridge.</p>\n<p>The forest and mountain humans are very dangerous individually, but rarely leave their territories in the</p>\n<p>Great Forest and Longtooth Mountains respectively. Hill humans are physically the smallest and weakest of</p>\n<p>the four human breeds, and also the most delicious, but unfortunately they prefer to settle in hilly areas far</p>\n<p>away from the goblin lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Adventuring parties are often made up of a mixture of different human breeds, united by their sociopathic</p>\n<p>urges, but other than that the various breeds usually avoid each other.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beastfolk</h2>\n<p>While the encroaching humans are certainly the latest and greatest threat to the tribes, they are not the only</p>\n<p>danger faced by the goblin horde. Nomadic bands of feral beastfolk wander the land, looting and pillaging</p>\n<p>wherever they please, and the bestial savages have no respect for tribal territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are many different breeds of beastfolk, some more common than others, but they all share a similar</p>\n<p>appearance – humanoid bodies with the features and mannerisms of an animal. The truth of their origin has</p>\n<p>long been lost to the annals of time, but their violent nature suggests that they were originally bred for war.</p>\n<p>Although some beastfolk are loners, most of them prefer to band together with others of the same breed.</p>\n<p>While these bands tend to be much smaller than the goblin tribes, a stampeding herd of minotaurs is still a</p>\n<p>terrifying sight to behold, and a sneaky pack of ratling cutthroats can prove a deadly threat when they catch</p>\n<p>their foes by surprise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most common of the beastfolk are the ratlings, most of whom live in underground nests deep below</p>\n<p>Northside Plateau and the Longtooth Mountains. The catfolk and minotaurs are somewhat rarer, although</p>\n<p>marauding herds of minotaurs are sometimes found wandering the plains, as are the occasional pride of</p>\n<p>catfolk. The frogfolk and porcupine people are rarer still, living in small forest communities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Other beastfolk have also been sighted on occasion. Pods of orcafolk can sometimes be seen swimming in</p>\n<p>the Endless Ocean, although they usually try to avoid the sea goblins. Former members of the Treebiter</p>\n<p>tribe also speak of a beastfolk king, who apparently lives deep in the Great Forest, where he rules over all</p>\n<p>manner of exotic breeds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Ogrekin</h2>\n<p>The ogrekin are the last of the major factions, and are divided into two breeds, ogres and orcs. Orcs organize</p>\n<p>themselves by clan, and live in small villages along the northern coast, while the ogres form extended family</p>\n<p>groups reminiscent of goblin bands, and prefer living deep within their mountain caves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both breeds of ogrekin have green skin and brutish features, and many of them sport tusks. Orcs tend to</p>\n<p>be slightly bigger than hobgoblins, usually around six and a half feet tall, while ogres stand at least a full head</p>\n<p>taller than even the towering bugbears, and frequently reach heights of over ten feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the ogrekin generally maintain a neutral stance toward the goblin tribes, territorial conflicts do</p>\n<p>still occur from time to time. Fortunately the orcs are primarily a seafaring race, and show very little interest</p>\n<p>in expanding their territory within the goblin lands, while the ogres usually seem content to live in their</p>\n<p>caves along the edge of the goblin territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ogrekin have a rather unique status as the only creatures the sea goblins will allow to travel through</p>\n<p>their territory unmolested. The reason for this special arrangement is unknown, but it has allowed the orcs</p>\n<p>to spread out across the Endless Ocean to other lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most ogres seem to show little interest in sea travel, but orc captains will usually recruit a handful of their</p>\n<p>larger kin as extra muscle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Other Threats</h2>\n<p>In addition to the four major factions, there are also some other creatures worth mentioning.</p>\n<p>First and foremost are the dark slimes, gelatinous blobs that absorb and digest organic matter, although</p>\n<p>they are strict carnivores and appear unable to absorb plants. Dark slimes are often found in Blacktear Lake,</p>\n<p>but will sometimes ooze onto land in search of prey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rather mysteriously, these voracious predators almost always ignore goblinoids and ogrekin.</p>\n<p>However in very rare cases a dark slime has been known to absorb a goblinoid, and when this happens</p>\n<p>they undergo a metamorphosis, transforming into a flesh wraith. This new form is still amorphous, but has</p>\n<p>a flesh-like texture, and it sprouts numerous eyes and fang-lined mouths. Flesh wraiths are very aggressive,</p>\n<p>and will actively hunt and devour any source of meat they can find, including goblinoids. If left to feed, flesh</p>\n<p>wraiths eventually undergo a second metamorphosis, turning into a troll – a near-unstoppable juggernaut of</p>\n<p>unbridled fury.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Trolls are fortunately very rare, as they’re extremely difficult to kill. Most of them live within Darkmire</p>\n<p>Swamp, although that could just be because they followed Darkmire Rapids out of Blacktear Lake.</p>\n<p>Trolls, like dark slimes and flesh wraiths, try to avoid salt water when possible, although it doesn’t appear to</p>\n<p>harm them directly. However this does at least keep them out of the ocean.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yet the Endless Ocean is no safe haven. The waters teem with sea goblins, aggressive brutes who attack</p>\n<p>almost anyone entering their territory. These aquatic savages serve as a natural barrier against attempts by</p>\n<p>the humans to enter the goblin lands by boat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, there are numerous animal predators that hunt the forests, and are hunted in turn by the tribes,</p>\n<p>who prize them for their pelts, teeth, claws, and meat.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5d6ol5f2t8t"}}}

{"_id":"H6Gj5Njz83H7gVIq","name":"Goblin Society","content":"<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"Art/Misc/GoblinSocietyPlate.jpg\" width=\"372\" height=\"78\" /></p>\n<p>An extended family of goblins is called a “band,” and each such band operates as an independent social unit,</p>\n<p>with around 50-100 individuals. When multiple bands merge together they form a “tribe,” with the strongest</p>\n<p>of the family heads declaring themselves chieftain, and the others forming the council of elders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over time the chieftain and elders may be replaced, but this occurs through challenges rather than lineage.</p>\n<p>Technically any member of the tribe can challenge for rank, but open duels are heavily stacked against those</p>\n<p>of lower social status, therefore it’s far more common (and even expected) for goblins to rise in rank through</p>\n<p>trickery and deception; the tribes far prefer cunning leaders over honorable ones.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although goblins are very prolific, they also have a high mortality rate. Therefore most tribes are eager to</p>\n<p>recruit and absorb any smaller groups they encounter, including minor tribes and independent goblin bands</p>\n<p>as well as the occasional gremlin, hobgoblin, bugbear, and even half-human.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All goblins are usually treated with an equal amount of sneering disrespect by their leaders, regardless of</p>\n<p>their breed and gender, with the exception of half- humans – who are only half goblin, after all, and can</p>\n<p>therefore be only half trusted. Some half-humans even attempt to live among human society, only to discover</p>\n<p>that the humans don’t trust them either.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Population Count</h2>\n<p>Around 100,000 goblins belong to the six major tribes, although there are many more independent bands and</p>\n<p>smaller tribes. No one really knows exactly how many goblins there are, as most of them lay low and prefer</p>\n<p>to avoid confrontations whenever possible, but rough estimates place the total goblin population at anything</p>\n<p>between 250,000 and 500,000 individuals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The other four goblinoid breeds are invariably far less common. There are an estimated 10,000 bugbears,</p>\n<p>most of whom either live alone, or in small packs with their kin. Gremlins are rarer still, numbering only a</p>\n<p>few thousand, with most of them living among the goblin tribes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hobgoblins are more numerous, but they are still relatively uncommon, with an estimated population of</p>\n<p>around 25,000 individuals.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, there are currently fewer than a hundred half-humans living among the tribes, with perhaps the</p>\n<p>same number again believed to be living among the town humans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Tribal Rank</h2>\n<p>Approximately a quarter of the goblins in each tribe belong to a gang, and these gangs undertake a variety</p>\n<p>of duties, ranging from scouting to hard labor. A gang typically consists of 5-6 members and is led by a boss,</p>\n<p>who earned their rank by demonstrating a blend of deadly skill, raw ambition, and utter ruthlessness.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a chieftain or an elder will assign several different gangs to a particular job, in which case a “big</p>\n<p>boss” might be ordered to lead the crew, receiving all the credit if the mission succeeds, and all of the blame</p>\n<p>if it fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Above the big boss comes the overseer, who leads a posse of perhaps 100-200 goblins, and is expected to</p>\n<p>act on their own initiative. Overseers are often given long-term missions, such as guarding a border, raiding</p>\n<p>a certain area, or recruiting new goblins.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Next up are the honchos, each of whom lead a troop of around 600-1200 goblins, depending on the size of</p>\n<p>the tribe. Each honcho is responsible for an area of the tribal territory, and they report directly to the chief.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally there are the elders, who primarily serve as advisers to the chief. Each elder is expected to have an</p>\n<p>area of specialty, such as arcane knowledge, military expertise or priestly status, and this will traditionally</p>\n<p>determine what role they serve. However in practice, most elders are just as ruthless and ambitious as any</p>\n<p>other goblin, and frequently pursue their own private goals and agendas.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"Art/Misc/MajorTribesPlate.jpg\" width=\"373\" height=\"79\" /></p>\n<p>Many noteworthy tribes have come and gone over the years, like the ill-fated Dogboys, and the aptly-named</p>\n<p>Cliffjumpers, but there are currently six major tribes dominating the goblin lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Redfang</h2>\n<p>The Plot Point Campaign in Saga of the Goblin Horde follows the trials and tribulations of the Redfang tribe,</p>\n<p>with the pint-sized antiheroes gradually uncovering the secrets of the other tribes as the story progresses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the size of each tribe fluctuates from day to day, Redfang is always the biggest, with upward of</p>\n<p>25,000 members at any one time. Their size is at least partially due to their equal opportunity recruitment</p>\n<p>policy; they will recruit anyone, regardless of breed, gender, competence, or actual willingness to join the</p>\n<p>tribe. Failing to outrun a cudgel blow to the back of the head is considered acceptance of their offer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bonedigger</h2>\n<p>At around 6,000 members, this is the smallest of the six major tribes. However it is led by a cadre of vicious</p>\n<p>little necromancers, who pad out their goblin ranks with animated corpses. These tireless undead fodder</p>\n<p>allow the tribe to punch well above its weight.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Icerunner</h2>\n<p>This tribe first appeared only a few years ago, heading down from the peaks of the Longtooth Mountains to</p>\n<p>claim its place among the major tribes. Many of the tribe members sport a rather frosty appearance, which</p>\n<p>is assumed to be a recent mutation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Longknife</h2>\n<p>Particularly sneaky even by goblin standards, most of the Longknife tribe populate a vast network of caves</p>\n<p>under Westside Plateau. These goblins are particularly well known for their dirty tricks, favoring ambushes</p>\n<p>and assassinations over direct confrontation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Nightsworn</h2>\n<p>The leaders of this tribe are devout worshipers of the Shadow Queen, and Nightsworn goblins can often be</p>\n<p>encountered on pilgrimages, walking from their home in Darkmire Swamp to the Dome of Shadows, at the</p>\n<p>north-west end of the Obsidian Valley.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Stonefist</h2>\n<p>Despite their proximity to the Icerunner goblins, there is practically no interaction between the two tribes,</p>\n<p>because the Icerunners live up on the mountains while the Stonefist tribe makes its homes in the extensive</p>\n<p>cavern networks running through the mountains.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Treebiter</h2>\n<p>Once the seventh major tribe, the Treebiters claimed a small area of territory to the south of the Redfang</p>\n<p>tribe, on the edge of the Great Forest. The Treebiter tribe was destroyed several months ago by the forest</p>\n<p>humans, wiped out in the first blow of the war.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5d6ol5f2t8t"}}}

They call</p>\n<p>this activity “adventuring,” and view it as the height of entertainment, showing not even a shred of remorse</p>\n<p>for the piles of hacked-up corpses they leave behind.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Of the four different human breeds, town humans are probably the most dangerous, mainly due to their</p>\n<p>highly expansionist nature, and they can be found in large numbers on the eastern side of Hightree Ridge.</p>\n<p>The forest and mountain humans are very dangerous individually, but rarely leave their territories in the</p>\n<p>Great Forest and Longtooth Mountains respectively. Hill humans are physically the smallest and weakest of</p>\n<p>the four human breeds, and also the most delicious, but unfortunately they prefer to settle in hilly areas far</p>\n<p>away from the goblin lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Adventuring parties are often made up of a mixture of different human breeds, united by their sociopathic</p>\n<p>urges, but other than that the various breeds usually avoid each other.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Beastfolk</h2>\n<p>While the encroaching humans are certainly the latest and greatest threat to the tribes, they are not the only</p>\n<p>danger faced by the goblin horde. Nomadic bands of feral beastfolk wander the land, looting and pillaging</p>\n<p>wherever they please, and the bestial savages have no respect for tribal territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>There are many different breeds of beastfolk, some more common than others, but they all share a similar</p>\n<p>appearance – humanoid bodies with the features and mannerisms of an animal. The truth of their origin has</p>\n<p>long been lost to the annals of time, but their violent nature suggests that they were originally bred for war.</p>\n<p>Although some beastfolk are loners, most of them prefer to band together with others of the same breed.</p>\n<p>While these bands tend to be much smaller than the goblin tribes, a stampeding herd of minotaurs is still a</p>\n<p>terrifying sight to behold, and a sneaky pack of ratling cutthroats can prove a deadly threat when they catch</p>\n<p>their foes by surprise.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The most common of the beastfolk are the ratlings, most of whom live in underground nests deep below</p>\n<p>Northside Plateau and the Longtooth Mountains. The catfolk and minotaurs are somewhat rarer, although</p>\n<p>marauding herds of minotaurs are sometimes found wandering the plains, as are the occasional pride of</p>\n<p>catfolk. The frogfolk and porcupine people are rarer still, living in small forest communities.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Other beastfolk have also been sighted on occasion. Pods of orcafolk can sometimes be seen swimming in</p>\n<p>the Endless Ocean, although they usually try to avoid the sea goblins. Former members of the Treebiter</p>\n<p>tribe also speak of a beastfolk king, who apparently lives deep in the Great Forest, where he rules over all</p>\n<p>manner of exotic breeds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Ogrekin</h2>\n<p>The ogrekin are the last of the major factions, and are divided into two breeds, ogres and orcs. Orcs organize</p>\n<p>themselves by clan, and live in small villages along the northern coast, while the ogres form extended family</p>\n<p>groups reminiscent of goblin bands, and prefer living deep within their mountain caves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both breeds of ogrekin have green skin and brutish features, and many of them sport tusks. Orcs tend to</p>\n<p>be slightly bigger than hobgoblins, usually around six and a half feet tall, while ogres stand at least a full head</p>\n<p>taller than even the towering bugbears, and frequently reach heights of over ten feet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although the ogrekin generally maintain a neutral stance toward the goblin tribes, territorial conflicts do</p>\n<p>still occur from time to time. Fortunately the orcs are primarily a seafaring race, and show very little interest</p>\n<p>in expanding their territory within the goblin lands, while the ogres usually seem content to live in their</p>\n<p>caves along the edge of the goblin territory.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The ogrekin have a rather unique status as the only creatures the sea goblins will allow to travel through</p>\n<p>their territory unmolested. The reason for this special arrangement is unknown, but it has allowed the orcs</p>\n<p>to spread out across the Endless Ocean to other lands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Most ogres seem to show little interest in sea travel, but orc captains will usually recruit a handful of their</p>\n<p>larger kin as extra muscle.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Other Threats</h2>\n<p>In addition to the four major factions, there are also some other creatures worth mentioning.</p>\n<p>First and foremost are the dark slimes, gelatinous blobs that absorb and digest organic matter, although</p>\n<p>they are strict carnivores and appear unable to absorb plants. Dark slimes are often found in Blacktear Lake,</p>\n<p>but will sometimes ooze onto land in search of prey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rather mysteriously, these voracious predators almost always ignore goblinoids and ogrekin.</p>\n<p>However in very rare cases a dark slime has been known to absorb a goblinoid, and when this happens</p>\n<p>they undergo a metamorphosis, transforming into a flesh wraith. This new form is still amorphous, but has</p>\n<p>a flesh-like texture, and it sprouts numerous eyes and fang-lined mouths. Flesh wraiths are very aggressive,</p>\n<p>and will actively hunt and devour any source of meat they can find, including goblinoids. If left to feed, flesh</p>\n<p>wraiths eventually undergo a second metamorphosis, turning into a troll – a near-unstoppable juggernaut of</p>\n<p>unbridled fury.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Trolls are fortunately very rare, as they’re extremely difficult to kill. Most of them live within Darkmire</p>\n<p>Swamp, although that could just be because they followed Darkmire Rapids out of Blacktear Lake.</p>\n<p>Trolls, like dark slimes and flesh wraiths, try to avoid salt water when possible, although it doesn’t appear to</p>\n<p>harm them directly. However this does at least keep them out of the ocean.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Yet the Endless Ocean is no safe haven. The waters teem with sea goblins, aggressive brutes who attack</p>\n<p>almost anyone entering their territory. These aquatic savages serve as a natural barrier against attempts by</p>\n<p>the humans to enter the goblin lands by boat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Finally, there are numerous animal predators that hunt the forests, and are hunted in turn by the tribes,</p>\n<p>who prize them for their pelts, teeth, claws, and meat.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"0llfus6nG1V829T5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_5d6ol5f2t8t"}}}
